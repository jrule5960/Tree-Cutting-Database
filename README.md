## About the Project

"Everything" is a web project that integrates Eclipse, Apache Tomcat, and a database for a comprehensive development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Eclipse for Java and Web Developers:** Download Eclipse IDE for Java and Web Developers from the official Eclipse website.

- **Apache Tomcat Server:** Get Apache Tomcat server to run your project in Eclipse. Download it from the [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org) and follow the installation instructions.

- **Java Home and Catalina Setup:** Set up your environment variables:

    - `JAVA_HOME`: Point it to your Java installation.
    - `CATALINA_HOME`: Set it to your Tomcat installation directory.

### Project Setup

1. Place your project files, including the "database" file, in your Eclipse workspace folder. You can find your Eclipse workspace folder by navigating to `File > Switch Workspace > Other...` in Eclipse.

2. Open Eclipse and ensure that your workspace is set to the one containing your project files.

3. In Eclipse, locate your project, expand it, and you'll see a "Web Content" section where you can access all the .jsp files related to your project.
